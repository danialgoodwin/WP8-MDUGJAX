WP8-MDUGJAX
===========

MDUGJax app created for the MDUGJax Hackathon. It has all the important information developers in the south-east US need to know. And more!


Features of this app include
* Live tiles
* Flikr API feed
* YourLastAboutDialog (YLAD)
* MVVM Pattern


I built this Windows Phone app using Microsoft's new App Studio. This code correlates with the blog post I wrote about how to edit App Studio code: http://blog.simplyadvanced.net/how-to-edit-app-studio-code/


Future improvements to made for MDUGJax (Anybody can add to this):
1. Add the MeetUp API so that upcoming events are added automatically. (http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/)
2. Add HERE maps so that users can click on the location of the next meeting and be shown a map of its location.
